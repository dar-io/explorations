    "page_description": "They say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, but many Las Vegas tours focus on getting you out of the city's neon lights and into the surrounding desert and canyonlands. Choose from various adventures, from trips over the Grand Canyon aboard a helicopter to ATV adventures in the dunes just outside town. Of course, if you’d rather stick closer to your hotel—and the casinos—you'll find lots to do, from taking in dazzling shows to experiencing the city at night from aboard a sightseeing bus.",

        "question": "What are the best tours in Las Vegas?",

But based on ratings and reviews, these are the best options:\n\n- Grand Canyon West, Hoover Dam Stop and Optional Lunch and Skywalk: https://www.viator.com/tours/Las-Vegas/Grand-Canyon-Skywalk-Hoover-Dam-Day-Trip-W-Lunch-from-Las-Vegas/d684-132218P75\n- Grand Canyon West, Hoover Dam, Breakfast, Lunch.

      },
      {
        "question": "Are guided tours in Las Vegas worth it?",
        "answer": "Yes, guided Las Vegas tours are worth it. You’ll get to experience the city beyond your resort or casino, learning about its 120-year history as one of America’s favorite nightlife destinations. Plus, many guided tours offer easy transport to iconic sites like the Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam.\n\nPer one customer who booked the Half-Day Mojave Desert ATV Tour From Las Vegas (https://www.viator.com/tours/Las-Vegas/Mojave-Desert-ATV-Tour/d684-18018P8), “This is a fantastic tour. And James our tour guide made it so much better. Great guy who is very knowledgeable. He made our experience fun and kept us all safe.”"
      },
      {
        "question": "How much do Las Vegas tours cost?",
        "answer": "Sightseeing tours around the city of Las Vegas start at US$55 per person. Day excursions, such as tours of the Grand Canyon and ATV driving in the Mojave Desert, range from US$70–US$170, depending on the duration of the tour and whether or not meals and hotel pickup are included.\n\nOn the lower end of the price range, you can book tours such as the Burlesque Hall of Fame Admission (https://www.viator.com/tours/Las-Vegas/Admission-to-Museum/d684-167202P1) for around US$12 per person. The tour includes entry to The Burlesque Hall of Fame but does not include additional sightseeing on the Strip. For an upscale and all-inclusive experience, private VIP tours like the 3-Hour Private Limo Photo Tour (http://viator.com/tours/Las-Vegas/3-Hour-Private-Limo-Photo-Tour/d684-108968P6) (from around US$1,284 per group) offer a chauffeured ride to the Strip’s most famous landmarks, a professional photographer to capture your trip, and complimentary Champagne."
      },
      {
        "question": "What do you see on Las Vegas tours?",
        "answer": "Las Vegas tours take you past the city’s top attractions, from the High Roller and Fountains of Bellagio on the Strip to the Mob Museum and old-school casinos on Fremont Street. (Or you can hop on a helicopter to see everything at once.) Day tours outside of the city are also popular—you can visit the Grand Canyon or Hoover Dam in the morning and be back at your resort in time for dinner and a show.\n\nConsider an all-day tour to visit as many attractions and landmarks as possible. For example, the Grand Canyon West, Hoover Dam Stop, and Optional Lunch and Skywalk Tour (https://www.viator.com/tours/Las-Vegas/Grand-Canyon-Skywalk-Hoover-Dam-Day-Trip-W-Lunch-from-Las-Vegas/d684-132218P75) includes an air-conditioned ride from Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon West and stops at the Hoover Dam and Eagle Point. Plus, you can customize your tour by adding a Grand Canyon Skywalk ticket, lunch, and even a helicopter tour."

        "question": "How many days in Las Vegas is enough?",
        "answer": "Plan to spend three days in Las Vegas. Dedicate the first day to gambling and enjoying the pool and amenities at your resort or casino, then use the next day to visit museums and attractions, see a game or live show, and hop on the High Roller. A third day gives you enough time for a day trip to nearby sites like Red Rock Canyon."

        "question": "What is the best month to visit Las Vegas?",
        "answer": "A desert city, Las Vegas frequently reaches temperatures above 100°F in the summer months, so you’ll be most comfortable if you visit from March–May or September–November. For the best hotel rates, try to plan your trip outside of major holidays or events, such as the Super Bowl or conventions and tradeshows."
